# squeal-final-v2
Created after Cordova plugin bricked previous version. Will be reflected in video submissions and further documentation. 

Please keep in mind that this repo was created halfway into development, and is not at all represenative of the sheer amount of labor that went into getting Squeal to function as intended. 

Favorites list not included in final package due to time constraints (yes, I did start early), a lack of familarity with Firebase databases, and the presence of other, more pressing matters.
